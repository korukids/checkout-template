# Checkout template

This is a template to use for the Koru Kids coding session. If you are using Ruby we recommend using this template to get started. You can start from scratch or use another language if you prefer.

## Usage

Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Run `bin/rspec` to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
